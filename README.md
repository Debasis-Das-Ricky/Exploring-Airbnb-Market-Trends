# Exploring-Airbnb-Market-Trends
This project explores the New York City Airbnb market through comprehensive analysis of 2019 listings data, examining trends in the city's high-demand short-term rental sector that caters to visitors seeking accommodations from a few nights to several months. The project demonstrates practical data integration skills by combining data from multiple file formats—CSV, TSV, and Excel files—a critical capability for real-world data analysis scenarios. Using three integrated datasets containing listing prices and locations, room type descriptions, host information, and review dates, the analysis uncovers patterns in pricing across different boroughs and neighborhoods, explores the distribution of room types (shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments), and examines host activity through review patterns. This multi-format data integration approach provides insights into the NYC Airbnb market dynamics, helping understand neighborhood pricing variations, popular room types, and host engagement levels across the city's diverse rental landscape.
